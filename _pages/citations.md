Here is my citation count, with data from [ADS](/myads/) and [INSPIRE](/myinspire). The MAX column takes the maximum value between the two databases for each entry. The h-index is computed from the MAX numbers (and h-index of $$N$$ means that one has $$N$$ papers with at least $$N$$ citations each).
