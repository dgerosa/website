Classes I have been teaching and the related material I developed. With a huge thanks to all my students!

## Astrostatistics and machine learning

_MSc in Astrophysics, Milano-Bicocca_

**Current material:** [dgerosa.github.io/astrostatistics](https://dgerosa.github.io/astrostatistics)

The use of statistics is ubiquitous in astronomy and astrophysics. Modern advances are made possible by the application of increasingly sophisticated tools, often dubbed as “data mining”, “machine learning”, and “artificial intelligence”. This class provides an introduction to (some of) these statistical techniques in a very practical fashion, pairing formal derivations with hands-on computational applications. Although examples will be taken almost exclusively from the realm of astronomy, this class is appropriate for all Physics students interested in machine learning.

## Scientific computing with Python

_PhD in Physics and Astronomy at Milano-Bicocca_

**Current material:** [dgerosa.github.io/scientificcomputing](https://dgerosa.github.io/scientificcomputing)

The python programming language and its library ecosystem are essential tools in modern science. This class provides an advanced introduction to python and its main functionalities, focusing in particular on its applications to computational physics. Targeted topics include: array vectorization with numpy, pretty plotting with matplotlib, scientific recipes with scipy, just-in-time compilating with numba, module packaging, and unit testing. I will also introduce other essential computational tools, notably Mathematica for symbolic manipulation and git for version control. The format will be highly interactive and tailored to the research interests of the participants.

## Machine for Physics and Astronomy

_BSc in Artificial Intelligence, joint Milano-Bicocca + Milano-Statale + Pavia_

**Current material:** [dgerosa.github.io/machinelearning4physics](https://dgerosa.github.io/machinelearning4physics)

Machine learning and data mining are quickly becoming essential techniques in the field of (astro)physics. Such powerful tools provide precious insights into the laws governing natural processes and shed light on the information contained in experimental datasets. This lab provides a quick introduction to such topics, equipping students with some essential background to apply their data-science knowledge to core physical problems.

## General physics for Computer Science majors

_BSc in Computer Science at Milano-Bicocca_

- [Fisica per Informatica. 2021-2022](https://elearning.unimib.it/course/view.php?id=40253)
- [Fisica per Informatica. 2022-2023](https://elearning.unimib.it/course/view.php?id=46377)

This is a general physics class covering mechanics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism, delivered to students majoring in Computer Science at the University of Milan-Bicocca. All class material is in Italian.

## Black holes and gravitational waves

_PhD in Physics and Astronomy at Birmingham_

- [BHs and GWs. 2020-2021](https://github.com/dgerosa/mpags_blackholesgravitationalwaves/tree/master)
- [BHs and GWs. 2019-2020](https://github.com/dgerosa/mpags_blackholesgravitationalwaves/tree/2019-2020)

This class targets PhD students (but interested master’s students can enjoy it too!) and was delivered within the [Midlands Physics Alliance Graduate School](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/mpags) (MPAGS) together with C. Moore and P. Schmidt.

## Year 1 astrolab

_BSc in Physics at Birmingham_

- [Year 1 Astrolab. 2020-2021](https://canvas.bham.ac.uk/courses/51751)
- [Year 1 Astrolab. 2019-2020](https://canvas.bham.ac.uk/courses/39797)

Astrolab is a first-year undergraduate class in observational astronomy. Unfortunately, the links above require a University of Birmingham account. For a paper describing an older version of the Birmingham Astrolab class, see [Elliott (2003)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0143-0807/24/2/307).

## Other teaching material

- **[simplestrocket](/simplestrocket/): Stacked ball drop.** A neat calculation on dropping balls on top of each other, from my year 1 tutoring sessions in Birmingham.
- **[nsphere](/nsphere/): Volumes of spheres in N-dimensions.** This is based on a “postdoc-lunch” discussion I lead at Caltech in 2018ish. I calculate the volume of spheres in many dimensions... Some surprises here.
