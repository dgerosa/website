Long-signal searcher, stats geek, thinks that everything is a sinusoid if you look close enough. He enjoys crunching numbers on a GPU, playing bagpipes, and using Bayesian probability to climb up walls efficiently. Also, Fëanor did nothing wrong.

**Caroline Owen**

**Nicholas Loutrel**  
*Postdoc*  
[nicholas.loutrel@unimib.it](mailto:nicholas.loutrel@unimib.it)

**Chiara Anselmo**  
*PhD student*  
[c.anselmo@campus.unimib.it](mailto:c.anselmo@campus.unimib.it)  
Black hole enthusiast, curious about gravitational waves. Outside of research, you’ll find her perfecting recipes in the kitchen, lost in books, immersed in anime, working out, or curating the perfect playlist.

**Federico De Santi**  
*PhD student*  
[f.desanti@campus.unimib.it](mailto:f.desanti@campus.unimib.it)  
Machine learning keeps him busy, Gravitational waves keep him curious. Astrophotographer, always in awe of the night sky. When not dealing with the universe he’s lost in movies, games, or the keys of a piano.

*PhD student*  
[m.boschini1@campus.unimib.it](mailto:m.boschini1@campus.unimib.it)  
Gaussian Processor, black-hole surrogator, Tolkien addict. Likes discovering new places, whether in the real world or in fantasy books. Often bothers friends with “simple” board games. Probably knows even how to build a nuclear reactor.

**Alice Spadaro**  
*PhD student*  
[a.spadaro3@campus.unimib.it](mailto:a.spadaro3@campus.unimib.it)  
Glitch hunter, LISA responser, gravitational-wave lover. Cares for nature, addicted to adventure sports (surf!). Likes building fun stuff with Lego bricks and gets charged up with rock music. Curious to learn something new and explore the universe.

**Giulia Fumagalli**  
*PhD student*  
[g.fumagalli47@campus.unimib.it](mailto:g.fumagalli47@campus.unimib.it)  
Eccentricity calculator, outlier nightmare, PN analyzer. Likes gravitational waves, black holes, and cats. Specialized in cakes, cookies, and any sweet treats (by far the best chocolate brownie in town!). A marathon every now and then just to let off steam.
