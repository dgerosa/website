Here is my publication list; click [here for a pdf version](https://github.com/dgerosa/CV/releases/latest/download/DavideGerosa_publist.pdf). You can also find my papers on [ADS]({{ '/myads/' | relative_url }}), [INSPIRE]({{ '/myinspire/' | relative_url }}), and the [arXiv]({{ '/myarxiv/' | relative_url }}).

My citation count is available on this page, and see [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgerosa/CV/master/publist.bib) for a bibtex file with these entries. I also write my thoughts about my papers in the [news]({{ '/news/' | relative_url }}).
