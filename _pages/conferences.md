List of conferences, workshops, and study groups I have organized, together with the related material (like slides) when available.


- **Conference: [XXVI SIGRAV Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation](https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/sigrav2025)**  
  The 26th Conference of the Italian gravity society is being organized by myself and my group: Milan, September 2025!

- **Conference: [Gravitational-wave snowballs, populations, and models](https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/gwsnowballs)**  
  Conference at the Sexten Center for Astrophysics, in the Italian Dolomites. From the dictionary: *"to snowball = to increase, accumulate, expand, or multiply at a rapidly accelerating rate."* Much like the GW catalog in the next few years.

- **Conference: [Challenges and future perspectives in gravitational-wave astronomy: O4 and beyond](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/challenges-and-future-perspectives-in-gravitational-wave-astronomy-o4-and-beyond.html)**  
  Conference at the Lorentz Center (Leiden, the Netherlands) on "new" GW things, with O4 predictions.

- **Workshops: [Linking Advances in our Understanding of Theoretical Astrophysics and Relativity to Observations (LAUTARO)](/lautaro/)** and **[Theoretical Horizons in Unraveling Relativity, Astrophysics, and Mergers (THURAM)](/thuram)**  
  Mini-workshops with Andrea Maselli’s group from GSSI L’Aquila supporting our joint PRIN grant.

- **MSc school: [Masterclass in big data within science and industry](https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/bigdatamasterclass)**  
  One-day class for Master’s and PhD students on artificial intelligence, machine learning etc. Was a great mixture of things, with lecturers and hands-on projects in astrophysics, oceanography, and cybersecurity.

- **Conference: [Gravitational-wave populations: what’s next?](https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/gwpopnext)**  
  This was an amazing conference we organized in Milan in summer of 2023. An entire conference (almost) without talks. Just discussions. And an amazing trip+dinner+thunderstorm on the lake. We should do it again!

- **Workshop: [With a little help from my friends](/with-a-little-help-from-my-friends/)**  
  One-day workshop held on April 13, 2022 in Baltimore to foster collaboration between the gravity groups of Johns Hopkins, Penn State and Milano-Bicocca.

- **Study group: [a PTA primer](/ptaprimer/)**  
  Organized at the Birmingham GW Institute in 2021, this journal club/mini class/group study introduces the basic physics of Pulsar Timing Array and some of the latest developments.

- **Study group: [stellar-mass black-hole binaries in AGN disks](/bhbin-agndisks/)**  
  This was a journal club / study group held at the University of Birmingham from October 2020 to March 2021. We studied the formation of LIGO-like binaries promoted by gas accretion in AGNs.

- **Workshop: [Hopbham](/hopbham/)**  
  Series of joint group meetings between my group in Birmingham and Emanuele Berti’s group at Johns Hopkins University (January 2021). An attempt to feel less lonely during the COVID pandemic.

- **PhD school: [GrEAT (Gravitational-wave Excellence through Alliance Training)](https://sites.google.com/view/greatnetworkschool)**  
  PhD school on gravitational waves I organized in Birmingham in November 2019, supporting the GrEAT network.

- **Conference: [Numerical relativity beyond General Relativity](http://benasque.org/2018relativity/)**  
  International conference on numerical approaches in modified theories of gravity, held in the beautiful town of Benasque (Spain) in June 2018.

- **Conference: [34th Pacific Coast Gravity Meeting](https://web.archive.org/web/20240605204541/http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~pcgm34/)**  
  I co-organized the 34th edition of Pacific Coast Gravity Meeting at Caltech, Pasadena, CA, in March 2018.

- **Conference: [The disc migration issue: from protoplanets to supermassive black holes](https://web.archive.org/web/20230531170901/https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/meetings/2017/migration.issue.protoplanets.supermassive.black.holes)**  
  International workshop on inspiral/migration in accretion disks, Cambridge UK, May 2017. It turns out planets and supermassive black holes have a lot in common!
