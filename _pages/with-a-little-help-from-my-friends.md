Following the April APS meeting, we will host a mini-workshop at Johns Hopkins University to foster collaboration between the gravity groups of JHU, Penn State and Milano-Bicocca. The idea is to get ["a little help from my friends"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C58ttB2-Qg&ab_channel=TheBeatles-Topic).

The workshop will be in the [Bloomberg building](https://goo.gl/maps/fUHZu98wS86XS6C59), room 462, from 8am to 5pm on April 13, 2022.

Breakfast and lunch will be kindly provided by JHU (thanks!).

The idea is to do a full day of brainstorming and come up with possible research projects, so **there will be no talks.** As a form of introduction, we’ll have some **1-slide presentations (strictly <5 minutes!)** to explain what we have been doing. The 1-slide, 5-minute format is a bit brutal, but it really forces you to think about what really matters (if you don’t see your name on this list, no worries: you’ll get your share of time during the discussions!). The afternoon will instead be dedicated to discussions.

Here we are! And huge thanks to the cookies...

## Program

- *Breakfast from 8am*

### **Morning, 9am–noon. Lightning talks – get to know each other**

- Arnab Dhani – ringdown overtones
- Ish Mohan Gupta – Fisher accuracy study, measuring NS/BH binaries with 3G
- Divya Singh – NSs and dark matter
- Daria Gangardt – constraining spin nutations in current LIGO events
- Viola De Renzis – measuring 2-spin effects in (mostly future) GW events
- *Coffee!*
- Andrea Antonelli + Luca Reali – systematics in 3G detectors
- Roberto Cotesta – PE in LISA
- Veome Kapil – COMPAS
- Nathan Steinle – A step back from pop synths?
- Konstantinos Kritos + Vladimir Strokov – dynamical formation code intro, IMBHs
- Mesut Caliskan – lensing in LISA & 3G

[People who are not on the list above could still prepare one slide: if there is any time left and they feel that we are overlooking some important topic, there will be space for that. This is all meant to be very informal.]

- *Lunch*

### **Afternoon, 1pm–5pm. Discussion – start projects together**

### **1pm–2pm: Tools**

What tools do we have and what we can do with them.

- GWBench tutorial (Ish, Arnab, Luca…)
- LISAbeta (Roberto)
- pyRing, Issues in ringdown parameter estimation, and tests of GR (Roberto, Costantino, Mark, Sathya, Arnab…)
- Including systematics, beyond-GR effects and lensing; population effects

### **2pm–3pm: Astrophysical models**

We love to do astro with GWs.

- Field formation models
- Dynamical models and multiple mergers
- Primordial black holes
- Spin effects
- NSBH systems
- NSNS mergers and tidal deformability, foregrounds and backgrounds…
  (Nate, Veome, Daria, Viola, Kostas, Vladimir, Veome, Gabriele…)
- *Coffee!*

### **3pm–4pm: Population inference methods**

Davide will start with a brief introduction to his work on machine learning with Matthew Mould + Steve Taylor and then we’ll think about what can be done with those tools, plus the PE tools we discussed earlier.

### **4pm–5pm: 3G/LISA science, systematic errors, tests of GR/BH spectroscopy**

The wrap-up: what cool science can future detectors do? What are the best long-term projects we can come up with by combining all these tools?

- *Dinner together somewhere?*
