If I don’t remember how to do something, sometimes I write it down here. Hopefully these are useful to others, some of them are probably (surely) outdated.


- **[installpython](/installpython/)**: My guide on how to install python. I wrote this back in 2015ish and it is now very outdated. We don't do things this way anymore. I leave it here on this website mainly for legacy; this used to be the most viewed page of this website by a large margin!

- **[local-apps-remote-server](/local-apps-remote-server/)**: Local browser on SSH tunnel. Browse the internet from home as if you’re on campus. A key thing during a pandemic…

- **[installlal](/installlal/)**: My notes on installing the LIGO Algorithm Library (lal). This guide is very outdated, don't use it. Take it as a testimony of how hard things used to be in 2015ish. Now it's a pip install dreamland.

- **[git2git](/git2git/)**: A quick set of instructions to move a git repository to another host while preserving the full history. For legacy reason, there are also some instructions on moving from SVN to git.
