If I don’t remember how to do something, sometimes I write it down here. Hopefully these are useful to others, some of them are probably (surely) outdated.


- **[installpython](/installpython/)**: The best way to install Python (from 2015ish). This is very outdated, we don't do things this way anymore, but it used to be most viewed page of this website by a large margin!

- **[local-browser-on-ssh-tunnel](/local-browser-on-ssh-tunnel/)**: Local browser on SSH tunnel. Browse the internet from home as if you’re on campus. A key thing during a pandemic…

- **[installlal](/installlal/)**: My notes to install the LIGO Algorithm Library (lal). This is also very outdated, but back in the days things used to be had (now it's a pip install dreamland.)

- **[git2git](/git2git/)**: A quick set of instructions to move a git repository to another host while preserving the full history. For legacy reason, there are also some instructions on moving from SVN to git.
