## Data
Public codes and datasets supporting my publications. There’s a bit of everything here: black holes, supernovae, machine learning, laTex workflows:

- **precession: Dynamics of spinning black-hole binaries with python.**
Public python module to perform post-Newtornian evolution of precessing exploiting multi-timescale methods. The code is described carefully arXiv:1605.01067 (v1) and arXiv:2304.04801 (v2), and has by now been used in many papers by us and others.

- **spinprecession: Black-hole binary inspiral: a precession-averaged approach.**
Some animations and data on black-hole binary spin precession, supporting arXiv:1411.0674, 1506.03492, 1506.09116, 1711.10038, 1811.05979, 2003.02281, and 1302.4442.

- **filltex: Automagically fill LaTex bibliography**
Are you tired of copying bibtex records when writing papers? We got you covered. This is a web-scraping tool to automatically download citations records from both ADS and INSPIRE and automagically fill bib files. Usage from terminal is straightforward, and it’s also integrated with TexShop!

- **skywalker: Things I like in Python** This is a python module made mostly for myself, where I collect useful functions and tricks to be imported from everywhere.

- **gwdet: Detectability of gravitational-wave signals from compact binary coalescences.** Tiny python module to compute the probability that a gravitational-signal will be detected averaging over sky location, detector antenna pattern, etc.

- **corecollapse: Numerical simulations of stellar collapse in scalar-tensor theories of gravity**
Animations and data release on core-collapse simulations in scalar-tensor theories of gravity, supporting arXiv:1602.06952.

- **surrkick: Black-hole kicks from numerical-relativity surrogate models.**
Public python module to extract black hole recoils from waveform approximants by directly integrating the linear momentum flux in gravitational waves. The approach is described in arXiv:1802.04276, here we also provide some animations from that paper.


- **spops: *S*pinning black-hole binary *Pop*ulation *S*ynthesis.** Database containing population synthesis simulations from arXiv:1808.02491 and arXiv:1902.00021 2005.04243 1909.06373, together with a simple python code to query it.

- **pdetclassifier: Gravitational-wave selection effects using neural-network classifiers**
Training samples and pre-trained neural networks to estimate LIGO/Virgo detectability. Supporting arXiv:2007.06585.

- **generalized-chip: A generalized precession parameter to interpret gravitational-wave data.**
Public python script to compute various definitions of chi_p. Supporting arXiv:2011.11948.

## Notes
If I don’t remember how to do something, sometimes I write it down here. Hopefully these are useful to others, some of them are probably (surely) outdated.
