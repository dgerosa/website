Here you'll find:

- **[Codes.](/codes/)** 
Public codes and datasets supporting my publications and other software I've contributed to. There’s a bit of everything here: black holes, machine learning, laTex workflows.

- **[Teaching.](/teaching/)**
Classes I have been teaching and the related material I developed. With a huge thanks to all my students!

- **[Notes.](/notes/)**
If I don’t remember how to do something, sometimes I write it down here. Hopefully these are useful to others, some of them are probably (surely) outdated.


- **[Conferences.](/conferences/)**
List of conferences, workshops, and study groups I have organized, together with the related material (like slides) when available.

- **[Other.](/other/)**
Yet more things on this website...
