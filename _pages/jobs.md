Do you like black holes and gravitational waves? Come and join us at the [University of Milano-Bicocca!](https://en.unimib.it/) Our science is great, the group is fun… and if that’s not enough, Milan is a truly beautiful city in the north of Italy. Mountains and lakes are just around the corner, food is outstanding.

Here I list a few possible opportunities to work with me and my group. If you’re interested in any of these, feel free to drop me a line at [davide.gerosa@unimib.it](mailto:davide.gerosa@unimib.it) to discuss the application process.


## PhD in Milan

If you’re looking for a PhD in gravitational astronomy, then Milan is **the** place for you! The deadline is usually in April/May each year for positions starting in the fall. Here is some [general information](https://en.unimib.it/education/doctoral-research-phd-programmes/how-apply-phd-programme) on the program, including funding, etc. Please get in touch with me at any time for tips on the application call.

## Postdocs: Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellowships

I actively support applications to the [Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellowships](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships) from the European Union, both their European and Global scheme. I supervised several of these applications (including a few winners!) and know the scheme very well. Our grant office in Milan will also help us. If you’re interested in this program, please get in touch. For winners of Global MSCA Fellowships with the incoming phase here at Milan-Bicocca, we can open a (strong) case for a faculty appointment.

## Postdocs: Cariplo Foundation Fellowships

The [Cariplo Foundation](https://www.fondazionecariplo.it/) is a private trust that operates in the Milan area. They have a [great fellowship scheme for early-career researchers](https://www.fondazionecariplo.it/it/bandi/ricerca/giovani-ricercatori.html), with full independence and very generous salaries. The deadline is usually in late winter / early spring. Please get in touch if you’re interested in applying with us!

## Postdocs: INFN group 5 fellowships

Every year, the Italian Institute for Fundamental Physics (INFN), which I am part of, sponsors postdoc fellowships for young researchers. This particular opportunity I’m referring to falls under the remit of the [Commission number 5 of INFN](https://web.infn.it/csn5/index.php/en/) which, among other things, covers machine learning applications. If you’re a machine learner and want to apply please get in touch with me! The deadline is usually in May-ish.

## Master’s and Bachelor’s theses

For students at the University of Milano-Bicocca, I have several thesis projects available, both at the MSc (“laurea magistrale”) and BSc (“laurea triennale”) levels. Possible topics range from dynamics of black-hole binaries, modeling of gravitational-wave signals, statistical and machine learning applications, etc, covering both theoretical and computational activities. More broadly, I am happy to design a project that works *for you,* based on what you find most exciting in gravitational (astro)physics. MSc thesis projects are often completed in collaboration with external researchers with students spending some time abroad. For efficient planning, I encourage students to get in touch with me about a month or so in advance.

## Research visits, internships

I welcome externally funded students and researchers who wish to visit my group to complete a project together. A few examples of funding sources include:

- The [StudyInItaly](https://studyinitaly.esteri.it/) program offers grants that can be used for research projects (and not only to formally enroll in classes here as the website seems to imply).
- For European students, the [Erasmus+](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/node_en) program provides funding that can be used for research projects.
- For researchers/students from Japan, have a look at the [Canon Foundation Fellowships](https://www.canonfoundation.org/programmes/research-fellowships/).
- For PhD students from the UK, check out these [Study Abroad Studentships](https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/study-abroad-studentships) from the Leverhulme Trust.
- For undergraduate students from the US, I encourage you to look into the [Gravitational Physics International REU](http://www.phys.ufl.edu/ireu/), where students engage in summer projects across the world, including my group.
- For students and researchers based in Switzerland, the [Istituto Svizzero](https://www.istitutosvizzero.it/residenze/) has a program for placements in the city of Milan.
- The [GARR Consortium](https://www.garr.it/it/ricerca-e-formazione/formazione/borse-di-studio) offers 1yr scholarships for graduate and undergraduate students with a focus on technological applications (e.g. machine learning).
- The [European Consortium for Astroparticle Theory (EuCAPT)](https://www.eucapt.org/) has travel grants that can be used to visit the participating institutions, including our group. Worth checking, their schedule is irregular though.
