Here we present my numerical code [precession](<../../../../../index.html?p=658>), which implements our multi-timescale way to look at spinning black-hole binaries. The paper has a detailed description of the various functions as well as lots of examples.

_Update_ : typos in Eq. (36-37) have been fixed in v3 on the arXiv.
