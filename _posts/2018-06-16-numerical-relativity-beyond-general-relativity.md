Happy to report about the great success of our workshop ”[Numerical Relativity beyond General Relativity](<http://benasque.org/2018relativity>)”. This was organized by me, Helvi Witek, and Leo Stein at the Benasque physics center (Spain), in the beautiful region of the Pyrenees, on June 3-9, 2018. Was great to see world-leading experts from so many different fields (numerical relativity, gravitational-wave data analysis, self-force, theoretical physics, cosmology, etc) interacting and reporting their progress on innovative uses of computational techniques in gravitation. [Here](<http://benasque.org/2018relativity/cgi-bin/talks/allprint.pl>) are the conference program and (some of) the talk’s slides.

I only wish the rain would have stopped for more than a few hours over the entire week. This is us with Einstein; we’re all beyond!
