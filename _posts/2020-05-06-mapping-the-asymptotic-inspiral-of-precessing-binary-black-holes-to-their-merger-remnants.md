A black-hole binary starts its life as two single black holes, and finish it as a single black hole. In between thereâ€™s all the complicated dynamics predicted by General Relativity: many orbits, dissipation of energy via gravitational waves, spins that complicate the whole business, and finally the merger which leaves behind a remnant. In this paper we put together different techniques to map this entire story beginning to end, connecting the two asymptotic conditions of a black-hole binary. This work started as a [summer project of my student Luca](<../../../../../index.html?p=2649>): well done!
