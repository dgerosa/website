Last week my group and I hosted the international workshop “[Gravitational-wave populations: what’s next?](<https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/gwpopnext/home?authuser=0>).” It’s been a blast! 

An unconventional conference, with almost zero talks and the vast majority of the time dedicated to discussions. I report the program here below, just to give you a feeling of what we discussed. The conference started with the question “ _How many of you entered the field after GW150914?_ ” and virtually everyone raised their hand! It was so refreshing to see our field is alive. 

We then went through population synthesis simulations, fancy statistical methods (I promise I’ll understand nonparametric methods one day!), intricacies of injections, catalogs, and overlap with our EM observer friends. We took a break on Wednesday for a social activity on Lake Como, with some folks diving into the lake and others hiking up to a small castle. All before dinner with a fascinating lake (and thunderstorm!) view. 

Thanks all for joining and participating so actively. Huge thanks to Emanuele Berti and Salvo Vitale for co-organizing this with me, as well as the local GW group for assistance. Finally, congrats to Amanda Farah and Alex Criswell who won our SIGRAV early career prize. 

And if you couldn’t make it for whatever reason no worries, we’ll do it again!
