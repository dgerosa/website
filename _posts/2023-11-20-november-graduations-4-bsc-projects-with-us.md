We had another graduation session in November, and a whopping 4 people graduated with research projects in our [group](<../../../../../index.html?p=2466>). Here are the new BSc physicists who just defended:

Congrats all (and twice congrats to Marco and Serena, who graduated with full marks and honors). It was great working with you. Matteo and Martin are now enrolled in an MSc degree in Artificial Intelligence (good luck!), while Marco and Serena are starting our MSc degree in Astrophysics.
