Two students just completed their Bachelor’s degree with research projects in our group. 

- Leonardo Toti worked with myself and Giulia Fumagalli on exploring black-hole merger trees in dense clusters.
- Simone Restuccia worked with Costantino Pacilio on applying dimensionality-reduction techniques to black-hole ringdowns.

I had the honor of heading their graduation committee and could call them “physicists” for the very first time (and the Italian ceremonial sentence is quite imposing: “ _coi poteri conferitami…_ “). Congrats Simone and Leonardo!
