I’m on the hook for teaching this semester (can’t complain really with such fun classes!). I’m down for “Astrostatistics and Machine Learning” for our MSc degree in Astrophysics and “Machine Learning for Physics and Astronomy” for our BSc degree in Artificial Intelligence. Here is my material for both, and thanks to all the students who will be engaging with this!
