Quasar 3C 186 strikes back! Matteo and I got interested in this funny quasar last year ([see this one](<../../../../../index.html?p=5769>)). When our paper hit the arxiv, we got contacted by the real astronomers who take actual data, who told us they had even more beautiful data. We ended up contributing with our relativistic model and… well… everything seems to work. 3C 186 is indeed a recoiling black hole (it might be a rare one, but we’ve observed it nonetheless). The abstract says “decisive,” and this is indeed the right word.
