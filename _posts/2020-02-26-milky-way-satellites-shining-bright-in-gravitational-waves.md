The LISA data analysis problem is going to be massive: tons of simultaneous sources all together at the same time. In Birmingham we are developing a new scheme to tackle the problem, and here are the first outcomes. We populate satellite galaxies of the Milky Way with double white dwarfs and show that LISA… can actually do it! LISA will detect these guys, tell us which galaxies they come from, etc. It might even discover new small galaxies orbiting the Milky Way! Surprise, surprise, LISA is going to be amazing…

_ps_. [Here](/posts/2020-02-26-populations-of-double-white-dwarfs-in-milky-way-satellites-and-their-detectability-with-lisa) is the first half of the story.  

_ps2_. The code still needs a name. Suggestions?
