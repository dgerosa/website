My group is hosting quite a few visitors this semester. We’re alive!

- [Francesco Iacovelli](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=author%3A%22Iacovelli%2C%20Francesco%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0) is visiting us for 7 (!) months from Geneva with a grant from the [Istituto Svizzero](https://www.istitutosvizzero.it/). Francesco has done some amazing work on forecasting the capabilities of Einstein Telescope.
