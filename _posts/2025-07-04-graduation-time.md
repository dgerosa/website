Congrats to Leonardo Toti, who defended his MSc degree yesterday with a research project with us. Leonardo worked with Alex Toubiana on improving the robustness of testing GR with gravitational-wave data (waveform systematics are a tricky business indeed). Leonardo will move on with a PhD at IFAE in beautiful Barcelona, Spain.
