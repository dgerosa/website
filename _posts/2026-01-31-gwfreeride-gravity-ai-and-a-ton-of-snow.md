Our conference ["GWfreeride: Carving the AI Gradient in Gravitational-Wave Astronomy"](https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/gwfreeride) was amazing! We had an incredible mix of GW people and AI developers (actual AI people, not like the rest of us, that's the real deal!). The workshop took place in beautiful Sexten, Italy, and we got a ton of fresh snow! The common theme was SBI (simulation-based inference) for gravitational-wave parameter estimation. Benchmarking is important; transformers are so cool, and Claude code is a friend of ours.
