Todayâ€™s paper celebrates the wedding of [startrack](<https://www.syntheticuniverse.org/>) and [precession](https://github.com/dgerosa/precession) (the nickname for this project was `pretrack` ðŸ˜‰ ). We use population synthesis evolution from startrack to predict the parameters of spinning black-hole binaries observed by LIGO. The spin distribution is then propagated from formation to detection using post-Newtonian evolutions from my precession code. The bottom line is that spin measurements can be used to truly reconstruct the binary formation channels, and some specific mechanisms (like mass transfers, tides, natal kicks, supernovaâ€™s instabilities etc.). Our [database](https://github.com/dgerosa/spops) is publicly available (play with it!), as well as a [little code](https://github.com/dgerosa/spops) to compute gravitational-wave detectabilities.

_Update_ : I think this is my 25th published paper!
