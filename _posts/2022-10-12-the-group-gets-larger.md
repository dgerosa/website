So many new people are joining us this Fall! 

- [Michele Mancarella](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=author%3A%22Mancarella%2C%20Michele%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0) is joining us as a postdoc supported by my ERC grant. Heâ€™s moving from Geneva (Switzerland) brings with him some new activities on gravitational-wave cosmology, because astronomy was not enough after all ðŸ™‚
- [Costantino Pacilio](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=author%3A%22Pacilio%2C%20Costantino%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0) is also coming in as a postdoc on my ERC grant. Costantino is a GR tester and is providing the group with some new connections to fundamental physics.
- [Giulia Fumagalli](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=author%3A%22Fumagalli%2C%20Giulia%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0) is about to start her PhD with us, also supported by the ERC. Sheâ€™s already done some amazing work with Alberto Sesana and Golam Shaifullah on pulsar timing array. Now ready for new GW adventures!
And spoiler alert! Thereâ€™s another PhD student joining in a few monthsâ€¦ More soon!

Welcome everybody, itâ€™s an honor you decided to do science with us! You can read their profiles [here](/group). And if youâ€™re also interested in my group, we have multiple [openings right now](/posts/2022-09-29-postdoctoral-fellowships-in-gravitational-wave-astronomy-at-milano-bicocca-italy). Consider applying!
