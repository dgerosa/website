I am the recipient of the [2020 IUPAP General Relativity and Gravitation Young Scientist Prize](<http://www.isgrg.org/IUPAPprize.php>). The prize is awarded by the International Society on General Relativity and Gravitation ([ISGRG](<http://www.isgrg.org/>)) through its affiliation with the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics ([IUPAP](<https://iupap.org/>)) to “recognize outstanding achievements of scientists at early stages of their career”. 

The citation reads: “ _For his outstanding contributions to gravitational-wave astrophysics, including new tests of general relativity._ “

A huge thank you to all my supervisors and advisors who supported me in these past years.
