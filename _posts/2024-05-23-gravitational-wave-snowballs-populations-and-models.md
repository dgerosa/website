We are organizing “Gravitational-wave snowballs, populations, and models” — a workshop to be held in Sexten, in the Dolomites region of Italy, January 20-24, 2025:

Our goal is to bring together researchers at the forefront of both forward astrophysical modeling of compact object binary formation and gravitational-wave data analysis in preparation for the upcoming O4 data release of LIGO/Virgo, for discussions focused on population-level modeling and inference.

The meeting will be held at Bad Moos Hotel right next to the ski slopes and the conference program will have appropriate breaks for snow activities; more details are available at
