Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are, I guess, the most complex signals that LISA will observe. From a data analysis perspective, they’re incredibly hard to detect, extract from the data, and characterize. This paper illustrates a possible strategy to do so, which relies on breaking the signal into chunks and proceeding "semi-coherently." Hopefully, we’ll find EMRIs this way once LISA flies!
