We moved (back) to the UK. I’m now a lecturer at the [University of Birmingham](<https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx>) (which is equivalent to assistant professor in the US). Really excited to start this new adventure!

My [group](<../../../../../index.html?p=2466>) is part of the Birmingham [Institute for Gravitational Wave Astronomy](<http://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/gwgroup/>). If you’re interested in joining us, have a look at [this page](<../../../../../index.html?p=2613>). And see you in the Midlands!
