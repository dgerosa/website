Usually my students graduate in Physics, but not this timeâ€¦ Together with [Matteo Boschini](<../../../../../index.html?p=2466>), I had the pleasure of supervising a student majoring in Computer Science. Alessandro Crespi got his BSc degree with a project on Simulation Design, which is really a computing thing but has lots of physics applications. That was so much fun! It is truly true that putting different expertise/approaches/ideas makes things better.
