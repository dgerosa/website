I was just awarded a large allocation on the Italian national supercomputer at [CINECA](<https://www.hpc.cineca.it/>). My PhD student [Viola De Renzis](<../../../../../index.html?p=2466>) (our parameter-estimation expert!) is the co-I on our proposal. Our award is part of the so-called [ISCRA Class B](<https://www.hpc.cineca.it/services/iscra/iscra-project-size>) program (which is their medium-size allocation scheme) and amounts to 1.2M CPUh on the Galileo cluster (that is: weâ€™re going to have to crunch _a ton_ of numbers now!). Viola and I will study the extraction of spin-spin couplings from black-hole binaries using gravitational-wave data and stochastic sampling techniques. Stay tuned!
