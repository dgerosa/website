It is a true honor to receive the career Prize for Young Researchers of the Italian Society for General Relativity and Gravitational Physics (SIGRAV). I was awarded the prize in the class of relativistic astrophysics. It’s amazing to be recognized in my home country; it’s great to be back! Let me thank all my mentors, advisors, collaborators, and now students who are walking with me in the adventure of science.

Here is me with the president of the society Fulvio Ricci. And here are press releases from the [University of Milan-Bicocca](<https://www.fisica.unimib.it/it/news/davide-gerosa-premio-assegnato-dalla-societ%C3%A0-italiana-relativit%C3%A0-generale-e-fisica-della>) and the [INFN](<https://home.infn.it/it/news-infn/4527-sigrav-premiati-tre-giovani-ricercatori-infn-e-assegnata-a-heino-falcke-e-ad-andrzej-mariusz-trautman-la-medaglia-amaldi>).
