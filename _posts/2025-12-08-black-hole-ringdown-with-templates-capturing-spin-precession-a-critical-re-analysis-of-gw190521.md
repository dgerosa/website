We looked back at the black-hole ringdown, the last bit of a gravitational-wave signal. Even though it’s a small piece, it’s kind of “safe,” in the sense that we know the shape of the signal very well from perturbation theory. The amplitudes in the ringdown depend on the binary parameters, which means those parameters could, somehow, maybe, in principle, be measured from the ringdown alone. Here we try to push this idea using a full data-analysis procedure, with an amplitude model that includes spin effects and an AI-based inference scheme. And it's the first paper by Chiara!
