Huge huge congrats to [Zacharias Roupas](<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=author%3A%22Roupas%2C%20Zacharias%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0>) who was awarded a Marie Curie Fellowship with us! Zachos is currently based at the British University in Egypt and will be joining my group in Milan in the Fall of 2024. The Marie Curie Fellowship program is a prestigious postdoctoral scheme operating at the EU level and, together with [Arianna](<../../../../../index.html?p=5464>), we’ll now have two Marie Curie grantees in the group. Zachos’ winning proposal is titled _“Black hole spin and mass function in gaseous proto-clusters”_ (nickname: protoBH).
