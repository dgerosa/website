This week we’re hosting researchers from the Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI) for a joint mini-conference / workshop / group meeting. More here:

This is part of a [PRIN grant](/posts/2023-06-06-lets-prin) we have together (thanks Italy) with support from other grants as well (thanks Europe). The meeting has [the best title ever](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lautaro_Mart%C3%ADnez>) (that was actually my idea…), the best logo ever (that was Giulia’s idea), and the best organization ever (huge thanks Costantino and Sara!).
