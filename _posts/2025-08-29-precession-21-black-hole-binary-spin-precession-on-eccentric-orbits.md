We were asked to submit a short document to the proceedings of the [24th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation (GR24) and the 16th Edoardo Amaldi Conference on Gravitational Waves (Amaldi16)](https://www.iop.org/events/24th-international-conference-general-relativity-and-gravitation-16th-edoardo-amaldi), and we thought this was the perfect occasion to advertise a new major release of our PRECESSION [(github.com/dgerosa/precession)](https://github.com/dgerosa/precession). The code was fully generalized to eccentric orbits using results from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.16893); Giulia also wrote a new orbit-averaged integrator. PRECESSION is now 10 years old, and stay tuned because we're planning for more!
