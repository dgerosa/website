Happy to share I was just awarded a grant from the [Università Italo Francese / Université Franco Italienne (UIF/UFI)](https://www.universite-franco-italienne.org/it/), a joint institution supported by the Italian and French governments to foster academic collaborations between the two countries. My proposal is titled ``*Populations of compact objects for next-generation gravitational-wave detectors*'' and was submitted jointly with Michele Mancarella's group at the University of Aix-Marseille. We have been awarded funds under the ["UIF/UFI Vinci 2025 - Chapter 3"](https://www.universite-franco-italienne.org/it/bandi-e-risultati-vinci-130391.kjsp?RH=UFI_IT) grant solicitation. This award will fully support a joint PhD student between our two institutions.
