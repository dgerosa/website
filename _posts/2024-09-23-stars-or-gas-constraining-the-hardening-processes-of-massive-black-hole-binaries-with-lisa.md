_To Stars or to gas, that is the question.  
Whether ’tis nobler in the hardening to suffer  
The slings and arrows of passing stars,  
Or to dissipate against a sea of gas  
And by disk end them. To inspiral — to merge,  
No more; and by LISA to say we end  
The models and the thousand PE samples  
That gravity is heir to._
