Today I’ve defended my PhD at the University of Cambridge! My thesis is titled “[Source modelling at the dawn of gravitational-wave astronomy](<https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/items/a591b598-4b46-4da6-b5c6-767bb4444b18>)” (with two l’s, British spelling here!). Huge thanks Uli and everyone else for the journey!
