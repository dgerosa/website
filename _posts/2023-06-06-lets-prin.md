Happy to report we got a grant from the Italian [PRIN](<https://prin.miur.it/>) program! This is in collaboration with [Andrea Maselli](<https://andreamaselli85.wixsite.com/home>) from GSSI in L’Aquila. The title is _“Gravitational-wave astronomy as a mature field: characterizing selection biases and environmental effects”_. Stay tuned for more research (and more positions to join [our group](\group)!).
