**Up-down instability S01-E03.**  
_“Previously on the up-down instability. After finding out that the instability exists ([S01-E01](<../../../../../index.html?p=2102>)) and calculating its analytic endpoint ([S01-E02](<../../../../../index.html?p=3077>)), one terrifying prospect remains. What if it’s just PN? Can all of this disappear in the strong-field regime? This challenge now needs to be faced”._

Today’s paper is the latest in our investigations of the up-down instability in binary black holes. If the primary black hole is aligned and the secondary is anti-aligned to the orbital angular momentum, the entire system is unstable to spin precession. We found this funny thing using a post-Newtonian _(_ read _: approximate_)__ treatment but we couldn’t be 100% sure that this would still be true when the black holes merge and our approximation fails. So, we got our outstanding [SXS](<https://www.black-holes.org/>) friends on board and ask them if they could see the same effect with their numerical relativity (read _: the real deal!_) code. And the answer is… yes! The instability is really there! And by the way, these are among the longest numerical relativity simulations ever done.
