More graduations today! I had the pleasure to see three of my students defending their scientific work. 

- Lorenzo Zanga completed his BSc project on unstable spinning black-hole binaries,
- Alessandro Carzaniga defended his MSc thesis on gaussianities in the LISA detector, and 
- Alice Spadaro also presented her MSc-thesis work on the LISA mock data challenge. I

t’s so great to see students reaching the point of defending/arguing/explaining their science… I think it’s actually one of the best things about my job! Thank you all for sharing these months with me, I’ll see you around! (And thanks to Viola De Renzis and Riccardo Buscicchio who co-supervised Lorenzo, Alessandro, and Alice with me).
