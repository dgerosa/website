Four BSc students and one MSc student defended their research project with us this month. 

- First, huge congrats to Federica Tettoni who got her MSc degree in astrophysics. She worked with Viola De Renzis and myself on labeling black holes in gravitational wave events. Such a fun problem (and we got confused so many times!).
- Rocco Giugni (BSc) worked with Matteo Boschini on finding issues in his remnant surrogate models…
- Giulia Foroni (BSc) worked with me on black-hole binary spin precession. The good old problem of the spin morphologies, but this time looking for two transitions at the same time.
- Matilde Vergani (BSc) also worked with me; we looked at merger trees and their combinatorics problem (her presentation had pictures of trees, I mean actual trees…).
- Laura Tassoni (BSc) worked with Costantino Pacilio on ringdown data analysis.

Thanks all for spending some time in [our research group](/group)!
