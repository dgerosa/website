Our research group meeting yesterday was... let's say different. For our summer group activity, we went to the beautiful [Acquafraggia waterfalls](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquafraggia) in the mountains near Chiavenna. Instead of black holes and coding problems, this time we went straght under the waterfalls (which was wild!) and finished it up with some amazing [Pizzoccheri](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizzoccheri). Thanks again to the entire group for your effort this year, enjoy the summer break.
