My group and I are now part of [TEONGRAV](<https://web.infn.it/CSN4/index.php/it/17-esperimenti/195-teongrav-home>), which is the Italian national initiative dedicated to gravitational theory and phenomenology. TEONGRAV is run by the [INFN](<https://home.infn.it/it/>) (National Institute for Nuclear Physics) and, besides the other folks here in Milan, it counts members from Florence, Rome, Naples, Padua, Trento, and Trieste. Looking forward to new exciting collaborations, all surrounded by good Italian coffee of course!
