I was recently awarded the [2018 Giulio Rampa Thesis Prize for Outstanding Research in General Relativity](<https://hyperspace.uni-frankfurt.de/2018/06/19/2018-giulio-rampa-thesis-prize-for-outstanding-research-in-general-relativity/>). The prize is sponsored by the University of Pavia (Italy) and the Italian Society for Relativity and Gravitational Physics (SIGRAV), and was officially awarded at the [23rd SIGRAV Conference](https://web.archive.org/web/20181103225836/http://sigrav2018.ca.infn.it). The prize announcement reads:

> Dr. Gerosa’s Ph.D. Thesis on “Source modelling at the dawn of gravitational-wave astronomy” shows an impressive ability to master a rather broad range of topics in relativistic astrophysics and gravitational wave physics. The research initiated by Dr. Gerosa in these areas has triggered follow-up work, providing new important insights and new physical scenarios. The large impact that the work of Dr. Gerosa has already had can only continue to grow.
