The University of Milano-Bicocca (Milan, Italy) invites applications for a tenure-track professorship in Astrophysics.

Milano-Bicocca hosts a vibrant astrophysics group consisting of 11 faculty members, approximately 25 postdocs, and around 15 PhD students. The group has a strong track record of securing national and international funding, with 6 recently awarded ERC grants. We are part of a larger physics department with about 70 faculty members and are situated on a dynamic campus with 40,000 students. Milan is a modern, international city in northern Italy, close to the stunning Alps, offering a lively cultural scene, excellent food, and a high quality of life.

Current interests of the group include gravitational-wave astronomy, formation and evolution of cosmic structures, and experimental cosmology. At the same time, we are open to all strong candidates willing to bring their ambitious research programs in astrophysics to Milan.

The position will be at the assistant professor level (“RTT” in the Italian system), a tenure-track appointment with a well-defined path to tenure within either three or six years, depending on performance. The anticipated start date is fall 2025, though this is negotiable. Responsibilities include conducting research at the highest international standards, teaching BSc and MSc courses, mentoring students, and securing external funding.

Interested candidates are invited to apply by June 12th, 2025:

Knowledge of the Italian language is not required to apply; the online application portal is available in English. We strive to build a diverse and inclusive environment and welcome applications from traditionally underrepresented groups.
