Happy to share that I was awarded one of the 2025 "Reviewer Excellence Award" by the American Physical Society, more specifically for my referring activity for the journal Physical Review D. 

From the APS website ([promo.aps.org/reviewer-excellence](https://promo.aps.org/reviewer-excellence))

> The Reviewer Excellence Award serves as a token of appreciation for those reviewers who have recently made exceptional contributions that are instrumental to peer review at the Physical Review journals. Our reviewers play a pivotal role in ensuring integrity and quality in our publications, and we deeply value the commitments and efforts of every reviewer. Each recipient of the Reviewer Excellence 2025 Award has consistently helped to uphold the high standards of our journals while providing valuable feedback to authors toward improving the quality and readability of their articles.
