We moved! I’ve had the opportunity to relocate to Milan, in the north of Italy, very close to where I’m from. I’m now an Associate Professor at the University of Milan-Bicocca, one of the two campuses in the beautiful city of the “[Madonnina](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonnina_\(statue\)>)“. Some of the folks in [my group](<../../../../../index.html?p=2466>) will be visiting Milan very often, and (spoiler alert!) we’re going to have new additions soon. I’m sad to leave the amazing group in Birmingham, but also very excited at this new tremendous opportunity.
