In the gravitational-wave world, we usually say a binary merger is detected if it has a sufficiently large SNR (signal-to-noise ratio). But is that true? Detection pipelines are far more complicated than that. Here we try to figure out a section threshold _from what’s detected_. That is: (some) people agree that these guys are GWs, so what’s your SNR threshold for detectability? It’s like reading in the minds of a GW data analyst…
