Another short post today, but itâ€™s not just [astrophysics](/posts/2022-03-11-astrophysics-with-the-laser-interferometer-space-antenna) that will be awesome with LISA, but fundamental physics too! Here is the white paper of the relevant LISA working group. Get ready to test your wildest ideas, my theory friend!
