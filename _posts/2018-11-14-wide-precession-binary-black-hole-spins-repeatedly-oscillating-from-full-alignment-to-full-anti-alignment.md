Latest in the series of our spin-precession papers, here we found a thing that was worthy of a new name: _wide nutation_(we had _wide precession_ before, but this is better). These are black-hole binary configurations where the angle between any of the two spins and the orbital angular momentum changes a lot. Can’t change more actually: spins goes from full alignment to full anti-alignment. And they do it many times.

_ps._ We found this wide precession during Alicia’s [SURF](<http://sfp.caltech.edu/programs/ligo_surf>) undergraduate summer project at Caltech. Jackpot!
