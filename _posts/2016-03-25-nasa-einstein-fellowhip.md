I was awarded a [NASA Einstein Fellowship](<http://cxc.harvard.edu/fellows/>) to conduct three years of postdoctoral research at [Caltech](<http://www.caltech.edu/>). My proposal is titled “Strong gravity to the realm of observational astronomy”. Here is a passage from NASA’s [press release](<https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-announces-astronomy-and-astrophysics-fellows-for-2016>):

_“We are very pleased to welcome this talented group of young scientists as the incoming Einstein Fellows,” said Belinda Wilkes, Director of the Chandra X-ray Center at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory that manages the Einstein Fellows program for NASA. “Their research will advance the quest to better understand the physics of the cosmos in a variety of directions.”_

Sunny California, here I come!
