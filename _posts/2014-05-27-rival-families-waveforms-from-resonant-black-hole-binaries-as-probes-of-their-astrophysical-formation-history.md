These are my proceedings of the 3rd Session of the Sant Cugat Forum on Astrophysics, held in beautiful Sant Cugat, near Barcelona on April 22-25, 2014. My contribution is in [this paper](<http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1507.05587>): have a look if you want to know more about rival families in spinning black-hole binaries.
