This week we’re all at the Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI) in beautiful L’Aquila for the second edition of our joint workshop with the local GW group. Thanks for having us!

(If you’re asking, the title of the workshop is a totally legit acronym that just happens to make up the name of FC Inter’s striker… So weird, [it happened last year](<../../../../../index.html?p=5734>) already, I really don’t know how.)
