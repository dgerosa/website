Gravitational-wave astronomy is moving. Quickly. In a few years we are going to have large catalogs of many detections, and a whole lot of information to extract from them. Instead of focussing on _parameters_ (masses, spins, redshifts) of single sources, we will want to extract _hyperparameters_ describing physical features of the population (metallicity, natal kicks, common envelope, stellar winds, etc). Here we show how to do this in practice: read our new paper for an amazing journey through hyperlateral cubes, Gaussian process emulators, selection biases, hierarchical modeling and more.

Our tools are publicly available! Here is Steve’s [Webpage](<https://stevertaylor.github.io/gw_catalog_mining/>) and our [public code](<https://github.com/stevertaylor/gw_catalog_mining>).
