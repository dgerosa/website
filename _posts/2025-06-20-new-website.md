As you probably just noticed, I have a new website! The old one was 10 years old (I started in 2015 during my PhD) and became too hard to maintain. The old website was developed in Wordpress, and the template I used was not supported anymore. Also, the hosting arrangments on Google Cloud were unnecessarily complated. So I finally took the opportuniy to learn Jekyll, which is the engine behind this new website. I'm using [this](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) template; hosting is done via Github and Cloudfare, which so far it's working great. 

For some nostalgia, [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20250530003117/https://davidegerosa.com/) is an archived version of my former website. Farewell.
