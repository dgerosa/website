The University of Milano-Bicocca welcomes applications for PhD scholarships. The application deadline is April 19th, 2023 for positions starting in the Fall of 2023:

[https://en.unimib.it/education/postgraduates/doctoral-research-phd-programmes/applying-doctorate/calls-application](<https://en.unimib.it/education/postgraduates/doctoral-research-phd-programmes/applying-doctorate/calls-application>)

In particular, the theoretical astrophysics group is looking for highly motivated candidates to join our activities in black-hole binary dynamics, gravitational-wave data exploitation, and numerical relativity. Faculty members with matching interests include Gerosa, Sesana, Colpi, Dotti, and Giacomazzo. Candidates will have ample opportunities to work with and visit external collaborators as well.

Our PhD admission program includes a number of “open” scholarships, covering all research activities in the department (including ours!). All candidates are considered for those by default. In addition, our group this year is advertising an additional “project” scholarship titled “Gravitational-wave source modeling” and supervised by Gerosa. Candidates wishing to be considered for this additional opportunity should indicate it explicitly when applying (the number of this position FIS.3).

We strive to build an inclusive group and welcome applications from all interested candidates. More information on the astrophysics group at Bicocca can be found at [astro.fisica.unimib.it](<https://astro.fisica.unimib.it/>). For informal inquiries and expressions of interest please do not hesitate to contact [davide.gerosa@unimib.it](<mailto:davide.gerosa@unimib.it>)
