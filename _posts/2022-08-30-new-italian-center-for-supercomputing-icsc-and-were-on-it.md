The Italian government is pushing a major inverstment program in High-Performance Computing, and we’re part of it! The new ICSC ([Italian Center for Supercomputing](<https://researchitaly.mur.gov.it/en/2022/08/24/national-supercomputing-centre-set-up-at-the-bologna-technopole/>)) will manage >300M Euros going towards early-career researchers, PhD scholarships, and computing infrastructure. The University of Milano-Bicocca is part of the founding member of ICSC, with our research group providing some core activities for the Bicocca contribution. If you’re interested in computational (astro)physics, stay tuned for several upcoming opportunities!
