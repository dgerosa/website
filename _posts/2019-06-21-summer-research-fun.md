This summer I’ll be working with two undergraduate research students. Luca Reali is finishing his master at my alma mater ([University of Milan](<https://www.unimi.it/>), Italy) and is visiting Birmingham with a scholarship from the [HPC Europa 3](<http://www.hpc-europa.org/>) cluster. Daria Gangardt just finished her 3rd year in Birmingham. Their projects concentrate on spin effects in black hole binaries and the properties of merger remnants. Welcome Daria and Luca, hope you’ll have a very rewarding summer!
