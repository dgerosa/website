Welcome to 2023â€¦ and what better way to start the new year than welcoming a new friend! Alice Spadaro (who has [recently graduated](/posts/2022-10-25-here-are-the-new-gravitational-wave-astronomers) with an MSc degree here in Milan) is now officially starting her PhD in my [group](/group). Alice always smiles, likes surfing, and of course is into gravitational waves ðŸ™‚ .
