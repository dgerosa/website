Welcome to 2023… and what better way to start the new year than welcoming a new friend! Alice Spadaro (who has [recently graduated](<../../../../../index.html?p=5136>) with an MSc degree here in Milan) is now officially starting her PhD in my [group](<../../../../../index.html?p=2466>). Alice always smiles, likes surfing, and of course is into gravitational waves 🙂 .
