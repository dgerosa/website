Our [group](/group) is getting some tremendous additions, with 5 people joining in the fall of 2023! The scope of our research is getting broader and broader ðŸ™‚

- [Pippa Cole](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/p_=0&q=author%3A%22Cole%2C%20Philippa%20S.%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc) is joining us as a postdoc from Amsterdam and sheâ€™s going to teach us fun things about dark matter, environmental effects on GW measurements, primordial black-holes etc.
- [Ssohrab Borhanian](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/p_=0&q=author%3A%22Borhanian%2C%20Ssohrab%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc) is also coming in as a postdoc (from Jena, Germany and Penn State before that), with all you can ever hope to know about 3G detectors.
- [Nick Loutrel](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/p_=0&q=author%3A%22Loutrel%2C%20Nicholas%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc) is a new postdoc from Rome (and Princeton before, and Montana before) which strengthens the analytical / modeling side of the group.
- [Arianna Renzini](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/p_=0&q=author%3A%22Renzini%2C%20Arianna%2C%20I%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc) is coming as a postdoc from sunny Caltech with her own Marie Curie Fellowship, ready to make a splash with stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds!
- [Matteo Boschini](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=author%3A%22Boschini%2C%20Matteo%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0) is a new PhD student, after a successful MSc degree with a cool project on numerical-relativity surrogate models.

Weâ€™re soon going to have [Giulia Capurri](<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=author%3A%22Capurri%2C%20Giulia%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0>) who will be visiting us for a few months from Trieste. Welcome aboard all! There are like 13 people at group meetings nowâ€¦
