Our [group](<../../../../../index.html?p=2466>) is getting some tremendous additions, with 5 people joining in the fall of 2023! The scope of our research is getting broader and broader 🙂

We’re soon going to have [Giulia Capurri](<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=author%3A%22Capurri%2C%20Giulia%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0>) who will be visiting us for a few months from Trieste. Welcome aboard all! There are like 13 people at group meetings now…
