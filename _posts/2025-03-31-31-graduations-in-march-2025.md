Four BSc+MSc students just graduated with projects in our group!

- Alessandro Malfasi completed his BSc project with Pippa Cole on combining PTA data and primordial black holes (a believer!).
- Nicole Grillo got her MSc degree in Astrophysics with a project, also with Pippa Cole, on EMRIs and environmental effects.
- Olga Pietrosanti also got her Astrophysics MSc today, and she works in collaboration with Alessandro Trani (Copenhagen), Evgeni Grishin (Monash, Australia), and Clement Bonnerot (Birmingham, UK) on black holes migrating in AGN disks.
- Giovanni Giarda (*…my name is Giovanni Giarda*) completed his MSc project with Arianna Renzini and Costantino Pacilio on a deep learning pipeline to speed up the computation of GW stochastic backgrounds.

… congrats all!
