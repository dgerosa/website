Our [group](/group) is accreting people at the Eddington rate! There are 5 new postdocs and 2 PhD students who have just started or are about to start:

- [Zachos Roupas](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=author%3A"Roupas%2C%20Zacharias"&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0) is joining Bicocca as a Marie Curie Fellow with an independent research program on stellar clusters.
- [Caroline Owen](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=author%3A"Owen%2C%20Caroline%20B."&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0) comes as a postdoc from Illinois, with expertise in fundamental physics and testing GR.
- [Alexandre Toubiana](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=author%3A"Toubiana%2C%20Alexandre"&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0) is joining as a postdoc from the AEI and likes gravity at all frequencies.
- [Rodrigo Tenorio](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=author%3A"Tenorio%2C%20Rodrigo"&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0) is a new postdoc coming from UIB (Balearic Islands) and he’s going to be the group member who’s the closest to real GW data.
- [Tristan Bruel](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=author%3A"Bruel%2C%20Tristan"&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0) comes as a postdoc from Nice and will bring us back to astrophysics instead.
- [Federico De Santi](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=author%3A"De%20Santi%2C%20Federico"&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0) graduated from the University of Pisa and will join as a PhD student.
- Last but definitely not least, [Chiara Anselmo](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=author%3A"Anselmo%2C%20Chiara"&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0) will also join as a PhD student after an MSc degree in Rome.

Group meetings are funny and busy these days, with too many ideas going around.
