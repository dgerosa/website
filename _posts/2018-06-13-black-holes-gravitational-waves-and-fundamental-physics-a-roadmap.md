This is a massive review born out of the European COST Action [CA16104](<http://www.cost.eu/COST_Actions/ca/CA16104>) Gravitational waves, black holes and fundamental physics ([GWverse](<https://gwverse.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/>)). We summarize the status of the field of gravitational-wave astronomy and lie down a roadmap for the immediate future.
