As we've done it for several years now, this summer we're hosting an undergraduate student from the US-based [IREU program in gravitational-wave physics](https://phys.ufl.edu/ireu/). Sterling Scarlett is joining us from Boston University and will be working with Nick on a theory-heavy project. Welcome!
