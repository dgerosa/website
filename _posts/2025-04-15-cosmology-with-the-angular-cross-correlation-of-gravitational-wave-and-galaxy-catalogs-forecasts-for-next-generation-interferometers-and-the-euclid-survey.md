Great paper led by our former MSc student Alessandro Pedrotti today! This is about combining the distributions of gravitational waves and galaxies to do cosmology. These two probes measure different things (distance and redshift, respectively), so their distributions will “match” only if the cosmological model is right. You can actually use this to _measure_ the cosmological model itself. Short answer: putting together 3G detectors and Euclid is a great idea.
