Daria Gangardt has just defended her PhD thesis at the University of Birmingham. The thesis is called _“Black-hole dynamics and their environments”_ and jumps from black-hole spins all the way to AGN discs. Daria, it has been a true pleasure working with you, all the way since your very first summer project and through your supervisor changing countries. I’m both honored and proud that you completed your PhD with me, all the best with everything. Time for drinks now! Go Dr. Daria!
