We had a really nice before-the-holiday group dinner yesterday night. We went to a very traditional Milanese trattoria, and almost everyone got "risotto con l'osso buco" (amazing, you should try!). Our Master's students joined us as, and with them we're now a group of 20 people. Thaks all for working together, see you all next year.
