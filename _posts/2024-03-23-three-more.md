Three more students graduated in March with research projects completed in our [group](/group)!

- Alessandro Pedrotti defended his MSc thesis working with Michele Mancarella on gravitational-wave cosmology going from crazy calculations to fun correlations and all the way to Einstein Telescope! Alessandro is now moving on with his career with a research placement at the University of Aix-Marseille. Congrats!
- Annalisa Amigoni completed a BSc project with Ssohrab: more fun with 3g detectors…
- Alice Palladino also completed a BSc project; she worked with Viola and me on a strange and mind-twisting “ordering” problem using the LIGO posterior (how many times did we get confused on this!)
