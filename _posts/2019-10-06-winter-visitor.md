Two close collaborators will be visiting my group this winter. 

[Vijay Varma](<http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~vvarma/>), postdoc at Caltech and expert of numerical relativity surrogate models, will be here on October 7-11. Get ready for his talk _[“Binary black hole simulations: from supercomputers to your laptop”](<http://talks.bham.ac.uk/talk/index/3838>)_ (aka: Everything you ever wanted to know about waveform surrogates). 

[Giovanni Rosotti](<https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/giovanni-rosotti#tab-1>), Veni fellow in Leiden, will be here on November 4-15. He will also give a talk: _“The observational era of planet formation“_. What do planets have to do with black holes? Turns out some stages of their evolution are set by the same equations. We have a lot to learn from each other! Giovanni’s visit is supported by the [GWverse](<https://gwverse.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/>) COST Action (thanks EU!).
