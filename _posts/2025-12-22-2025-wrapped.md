In 2025... We welcomed Matilde and a new Giulia. Ana, Rafael, and Sterling also joined for a bit. We said bye to Costantino who moved to Crete, no sorry I meant Rome, and Arianna who moved to Zurich, best of luck! Viola graduated, Giulia submitted, Alice is up next. We organized the SIGRAV conference, leaks from the roof included. Caroline knit beautiful things, Giulia baked beautiful cakes, Rodrigo and Federico vibed a beautiful cluster, Ssohrab made the most complicated plots in the history of plots... all of this while Alex keeps on discussing p_det. Chiara got a prize, Pippa got a prize, Federico got a prize, Tristan got a prize, Davide got an email from China that turned out to be a prize. Eleven undergrads completed projects with us (probably Alessandro, Arianna, Federico, Lorenzo, Nicole, Olga, Giovanni, Leonardo, Erika, Simone, Beatrice, woooooo). We analyzed GW data, run SBI inference, cried with SBI inference, triangulated what could be triangulated, played Sudoku hypercubes, screamed together under the waterfalls, and got lots of sushi.
