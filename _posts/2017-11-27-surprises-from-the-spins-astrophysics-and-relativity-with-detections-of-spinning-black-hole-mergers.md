These are my proceedings for the [12th Edoardo Amaldi Conference on Gravitational Waves](https://web.archive.org/web/20180124014028/http://www.amaldi12.org/) (July 9-14, 2017, Pasadena CA). I summarize how to use black-hole spin dynamics to learn about the lives of stars using gravitational-wave data. There are surprisesâ€¦

Before the talk, I was awarded the [2016 Stefano Braccini Thesis prize](<https://gwic.ligo.org/thesisprize/2016/>).
