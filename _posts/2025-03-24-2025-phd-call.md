If you’re looking for a PhD in gravitational-wave physics, our 2025 call for PhD scholarships is now available. The procedure is described here (Session 1):

[https://en.unimib.it/study/doctoral-research-phd-programmes/applying-doctorate/calls-application](<https://en.unimib.it/study/doctoral-research-phd-programmes/applying-doctorate/calls-application>)

The deadline is **April 24th at noon CEST**. 

For instructions, start from the file _“Guide to filling in the online application.”_ There’s a key step on page 10 where candidates can express interest in some themed scholarships. If you’re interested in [working with my group](<../../../../../index.html?p=2466>), I encourage you to select PROG.1 and PROG.3. 

You will need to submit your research proposal/statement. These are usually 2-3 pages long. It should provide some context about your work in gravitational-wave astronomy (or astrophysics more in general), what you want to do next, your key interests, what you would like to work on here with us, why you want to work with us, and more in general how you plan to integrate with our activities. It should be forward-looking and not just about what you’ve done already. Hope this helps!

For any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me: [davide.gerosa@unimib.it](<mailto:davide.gerosa@unimib.it>)
