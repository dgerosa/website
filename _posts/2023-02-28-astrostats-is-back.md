I’m about to start teaching this year’s edition of “Astrostatistics and Machine Learning” for the MSc degree in Astrophysics here at Milano-Bicocca. The material is available at 

[github.com/dgerosa/astrostatistics_bicocca_2023](<https://github.com/dgerosa/astrostatistics_bicocca_2023>)

Feel free to have a look if you fancy some stats… and please do send me feedback if you work through the material.
