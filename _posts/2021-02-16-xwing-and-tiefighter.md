We just received our new computing servers ([thanks Royal Society](/posts/2020-01-10-royal-society-research-grant)). These are two machines of 96 cores each and a ton of RAM, and will support our activities in computational astrophysiscs. Their nicknames are `xwing` and `tiefighter`. Huge thanks David Stops for helping with the setup.
