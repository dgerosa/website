LISA astrophysics is awesome and everything you might ever want to know is written this paper. [Sorry for the short blog post, but there isn’t much else to say really…] A huge thanks to all the captains that put this massive community-wide effort together. 

Pau Amaro-Seoane, et al. (155 authors incl. **Davide Gerosa**).
