Part of our series of spin precession papers, here we study nutational resonances. Those are configurations where the precession of L about J, and that of the two spins are in resonance with each other. These configurations are very generic (virtually every binary will go through resonances), but their effect on the dynamics seems to be small, unlessâ€¦ unless you end up in transitional precession! Transitional precession ([great paper!](<https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.49.6274>)) turns out to be a very special nutational resonance.
