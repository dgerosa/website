_Three fits for the non-parametric under data sky,  
Seven for the astrophysicists in their clusters of stars,  
Nine for powerlaw+peaks doomed to die,  
One for the sampler on his python throne  
In the land of LIGO where the data lie.  
One population fit to rule them all  
One population fit to find them features  
One population fit to Bayes them all, and in the stats bind them.   
In the land of LIGO where the data lie._
