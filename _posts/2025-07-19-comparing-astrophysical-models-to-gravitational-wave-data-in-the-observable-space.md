Our worst nightmare in the gravitational-wave population buisiness is $$p_{\rm det}$$, the detection probability. That such a crucial aspect that we spend entire discussion sessions at conferences trying to get it right. Selection effects are usually *removed*, i.e. one goes from a set of observed data to the intrinsic distribution of sources. Wouldn't it be easier to just model the observed distribution instead? Well, it's not that trivial, and indeed people thought it was not possibile without biasing your results. It turns out it is possible, but one still needs to model $$p_{\rm det}$$. But then, we argue, the comparison between gravitational-wave data and astrophysical models becomes much cleaner.
