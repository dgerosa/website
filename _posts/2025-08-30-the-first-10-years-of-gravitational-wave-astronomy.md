The first gravitational-wave detection happened 10 years ago (September 14, 2015). To mark the occasion, we have organized a public event, which will take place on Thursday, September 11, at 6 pm in the U12 auditorium here on the Milano-Bicocca campus. The event happens in the context of the [26th biennial conference of the Italian Society of General Relativity and Gravitation](https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/sigrav2025).

In addition to celebrating the discovery of gravitational waves, our aim is to tell the story of how major scientific breakthroughs happen --from detecting the signal, to confirming it was real, to fostering the growth of a scientific community. To this end, we have invited Marco Drago (the researcher on shift at the detector 10 years ago, and thus the first human who actually saw a gravitational wave!), Fulvio Ricci (head of the Virgo gravitational-wave detector at the time), and Emanuele Berti (president of the International Society of General Relativity). Science journalist Silvia Bencivelli will moderate the round table.
