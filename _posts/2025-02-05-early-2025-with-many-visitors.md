We’re going to have quite a few visitors in the next few months. They will be giving amazing seminars, with lots of research ideas floating around: Stephen Green from Nottingham, Cecilia Sgalletta from Trieste, Francisco Duque from the AEI, Angela Borchers from the other AEI, Lorenzo Pompili also from AEI (!), Ilaria Caporali from Pisa, Aleksandra Olejak from the MPA at Garching, Pantelis Pnigouras from Alicante, Lucy McNeill from Kyoto, and James Alvey from Cambridge. Hope I didn’t forget anyone… This is going to be exciting 🙂
