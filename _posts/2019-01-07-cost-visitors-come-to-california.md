The [COST](<https://www.cost.eu/cost-actions/>) action [GWverse](<https://gwverse.tecnico.ulisboa.pt>) is an impressive network of European researchers and institutions tackling gravitational waves, black holes, etc (i.e. the things I like… sweet!). Together with conferences and outreach, they support [collaborative visits](<https://gwverse.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/stsms/>) between the network members, so here we come. Hey wait a minute, Caltech is kind of far from Europe isn’t it? Here’s the news: Caltech is now an international partner of [GWverse](<https://gwverse.tecnico.ulisboa.pt>), and we’re very happy to host European researchers who want to collaborate with us in sunny southern California.

We’re having our first visitors. [Serguei Ossokine](<https://www.aei.mpg.de/person/44382/1589487>) from the [AEI](<https://www.aei.mpg.de/>), is here to work with me on a black-hole binary spin project. Yann Bouffanais from [University of Padova](<http://www.unipd.it>) (Italy) is coming to collaborate on formation channels. Welcome Serguei and Yann, and thanks to [COST](<https://www.cost.eu/cost-actions/>) for supporting our science!
