I just had the first lectures of a class Iâ€™m teaching for the first time: Astrostatistics and Machine Learning (sounds exciting? Well, it is!). This is an advanced course for the [MSc degree in Astrophysics and Space Science](<https://www.fisica.unimib.it/en/teaching/degree-courses/master-astrophysics-and-space-physics>) at the University of Milano-Bicocca. My students and I will travel across data inference, Bayesian wonders, sampling, regression, classification, and become best friends with deep learning. All of this is applied to astrophysical datasets.

The entire class is available under the form of jupyter notebooks at [github.com/dgerosa/astrostatistics_bicocca_2022](<https://github.com/dgerosa/astrostatistics_bicocca_2022>). The repository is hooked up with the [mybinder](<https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dgerosa/astrostatistics_bicocca_2022/HEAD>) service.
