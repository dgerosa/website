I'm happy to share that Dr. Philippa Cole, a postdoc with us, has been awarded one of this year's ["L’Oréal-UNESCO For Women in Science"](https://www.unesco.it/it/news/loreal-italia-e-la-commissione-nazionale-italiana-per-lunesco-premiano-sei-eccellenti-giovani-scienziate/)prizes. She was selected for the "Young Talents Italy" category and is, in fact, the very first non-Italian national to ever receive a prize in this category. Pippa's research focuses on the phenomenology of the gravitational interaction, with applications to both cosmology and gravitational-wave data analysis. Huge congratulations to Pippa — we are very proud that you are doing science with us!
