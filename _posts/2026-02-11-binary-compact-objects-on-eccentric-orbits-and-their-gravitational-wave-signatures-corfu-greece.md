It is a pleasure to announce the workshop “Binary compact objects on eccentric orbits and their gravitational-wave signatures,” which we are organizing for September 1st-6th 2026 in beautiful Corfu, Greece.

The discovery of gravitational waves has opened an entirely new observational window on the Universe, and eccentric systems represent one of the most exciting frontiers. While most detected binaries to date are consistent with circular inspirals, there is mounting evidence that eccentricity may already be present in current events, with claims ranging from high-mass and low-mass black hole binaries to neutron star-black hole systems. Understanding, modeling, and interpreting eccentric sources is both timely and urgent. The workshop will bring together experts in theory, numerical relativity, data analysis, and astrophysics, as well as early-career researchers entering these fields. We aim to create a collaborative environment where participants can share results, exchange ideas, and identify the next key steps.

The core program of the workshop will take place on September 1st-4th, 2026 at the Corfu Summer Institute, which is located in Mon Repos park, a short walk from Corfu town. In addition, the conference center will also be open and available to us on September 5th-6th; attendees can take it as an opportunity to work in small groups while enjoying Corfu’s seaside, beaches, and great food.

The workshop will have a conference fee of 350 Euros (250 Euros for students) covering coffee breaks, lunches, welcome reception, conference dinner, and two excursions (hopefully on a boat). While we are unable to provide travel support, accommodation in Corfu in September is relatively inexpensive (but the beaches are still great!). The workshop will be in person without remote options.

Interested participants should register on the conference website by June 1st, 2026. Depending on the number of people registering, participants might need to be selected. We will be in touch soon after the registration deadline. When registering, please indicate possible discussion topics you would like to contribute to.

Looking forward to seeing you in Corfu!
