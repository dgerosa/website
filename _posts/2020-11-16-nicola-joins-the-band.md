Itâ€™s a great pleasure to welcome [Nicola Giacobbo](<https://giacobbonicola.github.io/>), who starts his postdoc with us today. Nicola completed his PhD and first postdoc year in Padova, and is an expert in population-synthesis simulations, compact binary progenitors, stellar physics, and all those funny things. Welcome Nicola!
