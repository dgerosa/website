Together with Ilya Mandel, last week I organized a workshop titled _“Gravitational-wave snowballs, populations, and models”_ in Sexten (Italy). Both the science and the scenery were just stellar! We had almost zero talks, and the entire conference was made of brainstorming sessions on three topics “Parametrization”, “Correlation,” and “Falsification.” There are already several emails circulating with several paper ideas coming out of it. Huge thanks to all those who led and participated in the discussions. Here is the conference website…

… and here is us! We should definitely do it again. And remember: if you run population synthesis once, you shall be cursed forever.
