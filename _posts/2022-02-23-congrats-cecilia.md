Huge congrats to my student Cecilia Fabbri who got her Bachelor’s degree today. Cecilia defended (quite brilliantly!) her project titled _“Constraining the black-hole irreducible mass with current gravitational-wave data”_. Her work ended up in [our recent draft (arxiv:2202.08848)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08848). Cecilia is continuing with a Master’s degree in astrophysics at Milano-Bicocca, stay tuned for her future successes!
