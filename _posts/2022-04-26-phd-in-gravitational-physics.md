In particular, the theoretical astrophysics group is looking for strong, highly motivated candidates to join our activities in black-hole binary dynamics, gravitational-wave data exploitation, and numerical relativity. Faculty members with matching interests include Gerosa, Sesana, Colpi, Dotti, and Giacomazzo. The candidates will have ample opportunities to work with and visit external collaborators as well. 

Our PhD admission program includes a number of “open” scholarships, covering all research activities in the department (including ours!). All candidates are considered for those by default. In addition, our group sponsors two specific positions:

Candidates wishing to be considered for these additional positions should mention it explicitly in their application.

More information on the astrophysics group at Bicocca can be found at [astro.fisica.unimib.it](<http://astro.fisica.unimib.it/>).
