Very happy to report that Arianna Renzini (currently a postdoc at Caltech) was awarded a prestigious Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellowship from the European Union, to be hosted here with my group. Arianna will bring expertise in modeling the gravitational-wave stochastic background, which is a key target for both current and future experiments. Arianna’s proposal is titled “ _Stochastic rewind and fast-forward: calibrating LISA with LIGO’s black holes and stochastic background_.” Huge congrats, can’t wait to welcome you here.
