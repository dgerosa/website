I was recently appointed to the [Astronomy Working Group (AWG)](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/awg) of the [European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int/). The AWG is an advisory team composed of 12 academics from ESA's member states, which provides scientific advice to advance ESA's science missions. Appointments are for three years; I'll be part of the AWG from 2026 to 2028. Current AWG members are available [here](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/awg/members).
