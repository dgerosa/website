Wooo! What an amazing performance by two of my students today, who defended their BSc and MSc degrees! 

- Oliver Rossi discussed his BSc project on black holes with large spins completed in collaboration with Viola De Renzis (PhD student in my group). 
- Andrea Geminardi presented the results of his MSc thesis. Andrea studied the stochastic gravitational-wave background with myself, Riccardo Buscicchio (postdoc here in Milan), and Arianna Renzini (postdoc at Caltech).

 Hope you guys had fun working with us, we certainly did! (and I’m sorry for my pain-in-the-*** comments on your plots…). All the best for what comes next!
