Last week, [my group and I hosted the biennial conference of the Italian GR society (SIGRAV)](posts/2025-02-28-26th-sigrav-conference-on-general-relativity-and-gravitation). We had about 160 relativists coming to Milan, with talks ranginig from relativity theory and quantum gravity all the way to GW-and-not-GW experiments. [Our public event](posts/2025-08-30-the-first-10-years-of-gravitational-wave-astronomy) on the first ten years of gravitational-wave astornomy has about 200 people, including many high school students. Thanks all for joining, the next SIGRAV conference is in 2 years, somewhere else in Italy.
