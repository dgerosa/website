The [University of Milano-Bicocca](<https://en.unimib.it/>) welcomes applications for Ph.D. scholarships. The application deadline is **June 16th, 2021** for positions to start later in 2021:

In particular, I am looking for a strong, highly motivated candidate to join my newly established research group supported by the [European Research Council](<../../../../../index.html?p=3637>). The candidate will work toward interpreting the phenomenology and the astrophysics of gravitational-wave sources using innovative machine-learning techniques. My activities are embedded within the wider Astrophysics group at the University of Milano-Bicocca –a world-leading research environment in strong gravity and relativistic astrophysics. Faculty members with matching interests include Colpi, Sesana, Dotti, and Giacomazzo. The candidate will have ample opportunities to work with and visit external collaborators as well.

This specific position is titled _“Large catalogs of gravitational-wave events with machine learning”._ Interested candidates should mention it explicitly in their application.

Milan is a beautiful, international city in the north of Italy. Mountains and lakes are just around the corner. For further information and informal inquiries please do not hesitate to contact me ([davide.gerosa@unimib.it](<mailto:davide.gerosa@unimib.it>)).
