Huge congratulations to Giulia Fumagalli, who successfully defended her PhD thesis titled *“Dynamics of spin-Precessing and eccentric compact binaries in post-Newtonian theory.”* Her thesis was refereed by Mike Zevin and Leo Stein, and the defense committee included Jose Maria Ezquiaga, Leonardo Gualtieri, and Matteo Bonetti. Giulia’s PhD was awarded with honors.
Giulia has now started a postdoc at Caltech (USA) with a prestigious Burke Fellowship. Thank you, Giulia, for working with me/us over the past three years of science, hikes, and cakes.
