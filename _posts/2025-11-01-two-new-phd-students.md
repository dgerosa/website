We welcome two new PhD students, who are starting their research in my [group](/group):

- Matilde Garcia graduated with a MSc from the Niels Bohr Institute, Copenhagen, after a BSc in Lisbon (I still need to learn how to properly pronounce "Matilde" the Portuguese way!), she previously worked on GW lensing.
- Giulia Cuomo graduated from the University of Bologna with a project on GW cosmology.

(and they both got papers already ([here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14073) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18243))!)

We can't wait to start working with you.
