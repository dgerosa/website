Traveling is (kind of) coming back, and we’re having lots of visitors around, all supported by external research grants (congrats folks, you’re great!):

- Daria Gangardt is visiting Milan from Birmingham for 6 months from January to July, supported by a [StudyInItaly](https://studyinitaly.esteri.it/) research grant from the Italian embassy (thanks Italy!).
- Floor Broekgaarden joins the group from Harvard for 2 months, supported by the [HPCEuropa3](https://www.hpc-europa.org/) program (thanks Europe!).
- Matt Mould will be in Milan in April (again thanks to [HPCEuropa3](https://www.hpc-europa.org/)).
- Viola De Renzis instead will be visiting Birmingham in March (once more thanks to [HPCEuropa3](https://www.hpc-europa.org/), such a great program!).
- Nate Steinle will also be in Milan in late April. Wooo!

Safe travel everyone, it’s time we move our group meetings to a larger room.
