FIS (“Fondo Italiano per la Scienza”) is an Italian grant opportunity which is conceptually similar to the ERC. The amount of these grants is >= 1M EUR and grant holders are offered a tenure-track or tenured position. The deadline for this year’s solicitation (FIS 3) is Mar 28, 2025. If you’re interested in applying with Milano-Bicocca as host institution please shoot me an email!
