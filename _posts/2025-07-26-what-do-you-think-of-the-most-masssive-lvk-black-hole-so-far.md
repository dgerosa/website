We're all at the big [GR+Amaldi conference](https://iop.eventsair.com/gr24-amaldi16/) this week, and the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA folks have been announcing their most massive gravitational-wave event so far, GW231123. I was asked about it by a few journalist, from both New Scientis [(*"LIGO has spotted the most massive black hole collision ever detected"*)](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2488074-ligo-has-spotted-the-most-massive-black-hole-collision-ever-detected/) and the American Physical Society [(*"Heaviest Black Hole Merger Flouts a Forbidden Gap"*)](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2488074-ligo-has-spotted-the-most-massive-black-hole-collision-ever-detected/). Exciting stuff indeed! My thoughts on the hierarchical-merger formation idea are that it's likely but not obvious at the same time.
