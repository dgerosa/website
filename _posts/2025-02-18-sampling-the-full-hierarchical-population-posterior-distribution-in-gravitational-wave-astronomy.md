When inferring black holes from gravitational-wave data, we tend to do two things, one after the other. First, we consider each event individually and measure its parameters (masses, spins, etc). Then we consider all the events together and measure the population properties. This is what we do all the time, but, actually, if objects are now part of a population, those parameters should be looked at again in light of all the others. This full problem (all parameters of all the events plus the population parameters) is daunting, and [in the past](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02462) we used an indirect and somewhat convoluted approach. We got back to it now, and this time, we managed to do it head-on. Let me introduce this giant 500-dimensional sampling of the full population problem!
