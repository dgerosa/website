We’re back to predicting the excitation amplitude of black hole merger ringdowns. [We already looked](<../../../../../index.html?p=6125>) into the simpler case of binaries with aligned spins, and now tried to study the full problem of binaries with misaligned (i.e. processing) spins. Well, this is a hard problem! It’s not even clear which mode is the stronger one anymore, and finding suitable coordinates is not at all trivial. While this is just a first exploration, there’s so much interesting phenomenology here! Do it yourself with the [postmerger](<https://github.com/cpacilio/postmerger>) package.
