What’s in between neutron stars and black holes? It looks like neutron stars have a _maximum_ mass of about 2 solar masses while black holes have a _minimum_ mass of about 5. So what’s in between? That’s the popular issue of the ‘low mass gap’. Actually, now we _know_ something must be in there. LIGO and Virgo have seen GW170817, a merger of two neutron stars, which merged in to a black hole with the right mass to populate the gap. Can this population be seen directly with (future) gravitational-wave detectors? That’s today’s paper.
