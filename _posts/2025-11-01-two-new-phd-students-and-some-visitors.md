We welcome two new PhD students, who are starting their research in my [group](/group):

- Matilde Garcia graduated with a MSc from the Niels Bohr Institute, Copenhagen, after a BSc in Lisbon (I still need to learn how to properly pronounce "Matilde" the Portuguese way!), she previously worked on GW lensing.
- Giulia Cuomo graduated from the University of Bologna with a project on GW cosmology.

(and they both got papers already, [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14073) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18243)!)

We're also going to have some long-term visitors this year, all staying for many months:

- Ana Lorenzo Medina is joining us as a visiting PhD student from the University of Santiago de Compostela (Spain);
- Rafael Mancini Santos is also joining as a visiting PhD student, from from INPE (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais) in in Sao Paulo, Brazil;
- And Alessandro Trani will also be here for quite a bit with a mini-contract before starting his faculty job in Chile. 

We can't wait to start working with you!
