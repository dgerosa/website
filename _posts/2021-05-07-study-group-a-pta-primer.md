The next few years are expected to be a golden age for pulsar timing array (PTA) science. The recent tentative claim of a detection of an astrophysical signal in the NANOGrav 12.5-year data set is expected to be confirmed, thereby opening a new observational window on supermassive black holes. In order to better follow these developments, Chris Moore and I will run a spring journal club in which we aim to review some key papers in the field.
