I’m teaching the first lecture of a new class today. This is “Scientific computing with Python,” a 16h module for PhD students. To the (many) PhD students who signed up: thanks for your interest, hope you’ll like this. BTW the title says Python but there will also be some Mathematica and some git, just for fun. My material is online at

Have a look if you want and please do give feedback if you do 🙂
