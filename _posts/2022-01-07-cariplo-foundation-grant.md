I’m very happy to share that I was awarded a 330k EUR grant from the [Cariplo Foundation](<https://www.fondazionecariplo.it/en/index.html>). Cariplo is a trust that supports scientific research in the Lombardy region of Italy. Our proposal is titled “[Deep into the relativistic two-body problem](<https://www.fondazionecariplo.it/static/upload/rst/rst_bandoerc2021_1dic21.pdf>)“, though arguably a better title could have been “more black-hole fun coming our way”!
