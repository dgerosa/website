In 2024…. We welcomed Tristan, Chiara, Caroline, Rodrigo, Alex, Federico, and Zachos (group accretion at the Eddington limit). Michele started a faculty in Marseille, Daria graduated, Viola almost graduated and is fighting the paperwork in Marseille, Giulia went to Cambridge, Alice went to the AEI, Cecilia went to Nottingham, Costantino went to Novara. Ringdowns, EMRIs, stochastic backgrounds, p_det, catastrophes, SBI, and 3G detectors don’t have secrets for us. I think 13 BSc and 3 MSc students defended their projects with us, not sure. Arianna and Nick are two Giovani Talenti, Alex is a Young Researcher. We went to the lake together, got risotto together, and organized a conference named after Inter’s striker. If you don’t know what to eat for dinner, define a likelihood and sample it (Loutrel et al. 2024). Or put pins on google maps (Borhanian et al. 2024). You look at data, I look at the physics (Bruel et al. 2024).
