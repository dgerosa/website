On top of “[astrostats](/posts/2024-03-06-astrostatistics-and-machine-learning-v2024)” for the MSc degree in Astrophysics, this semester I’m excited to start teaching for the new [BSc degree in Artificial Intelligence](<https://bai.unipv.it/>). This course is delivered jointly by the University of Milano-Bicocca (my place), the University of Milano-Statale (“the other” uni in town), and the University of Pavia (south of here…). My class is actually a lab, the full (too long) title is “Laboratory of Machine Learning Applied to Physical Systems.” The class material is available here:

Can’t wait to see what these AI students can do! Hope to learn from you as much as you learn from me.
