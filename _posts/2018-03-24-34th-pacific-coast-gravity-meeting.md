The [34th edition of the Pacific Coast Gravity Meeting](<http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~pcgm34/>), sponsored by the APS, was held at Caltech on March 16-17, 2018. This year’ edition was organized by me, Leo Stein and a few others, and was dedicated to Jim Isenberg who first started the Pacific Gravity meetings 34 years ago. We had a beautiful blend of people (including some very talented undergrads!) and topics (from numerical relativity, to quantum gravity, high-energy physics and gravitational-wave astronomy). I hope everybody had fun. I surely did!

Here is the [conference program](<http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~pcgm34/Schedule/>), and this below is the logo that I designed (It’s supposed to be Newton’s apple with some gravitational waves in Caltech’s orange color; I know, I’m a scientist, not an artist…). And congrats to Maria Okounkova who won the best student talk award of the APS.
