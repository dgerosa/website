Happy to share a postdoc opportunity from the Cariplo Foundation, which is a private trust that operates in northern Italy:

https://www.fondazionecariplo.it/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Young-researchers-2026.pdf

It's an independent fellowship for early-career researchers, with a duration of 3+1 years and a total budget of 200k EUR. Their eligibility criteria are kind of specific though; they only want people who got their PhD between April 14th, 2024 and April 14th, 2026 (which is the submission deadline). The starting date is flexible, sometime between January 2027 and September 2027.

If anyone here is interested in applying with us at Milano-Bicocca please shoot us an email!
