As you can imagine, I’m kind of obsessed with black hole binaries. So easy (let’s face it, a black hole is easy! Just mass and spin), but at the same time so terribly complicated… Happy to present our attempt to _see_ the binary dynamics in real time. Technical blah blah: we attach a visualization tool to a numerical relativity surrogate model. Are you ready to be a binary black hole explorer?

_ps._ Kids can have fun with black holes too! From [mikesmathpage](<https://mikesmathpage.wordpress.com/2018/11/20/having-kids-play-with-the-binary-black-hole-explorer-made-my-vijay-varma-leo-stein-and-davide-gerosa/>).
