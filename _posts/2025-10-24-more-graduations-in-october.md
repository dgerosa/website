We've had more student graduations in October. 

- Federico Quattrini got his BSc degree working with Caroline Owen on waveforms systematics in GW populations
- Beatrice Sala got her MSc degree working with Alex Toubiana, Monica Colpi, and myself on combining LISA and ET data; she's got a spot in this year's call of the Italian National PhD in Space Physics, so stay tuned for her future science. Congrats!
