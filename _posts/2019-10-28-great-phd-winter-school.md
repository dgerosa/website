This week I am organizing the [GrEAT PhD winter school](<https://sites.google.com/view/greatnetworkschool>). GrEAT (which stands for Gravitational-wave Excellence through Alliance Training) is a [synergy network](<https://gilsay.physics.gla.ac.uk/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=great_network:start>) between the UK and China. Our program features informal talks in the mornings and hands-on sessions in the afternoons, covering both theoretical and experimental gravitational-wave physics.

After the school in Birmingham, students will move on to various UK nodes to complete longer projects. In particular, Mingyue Zhou will stay here working with me.
