…and we’re back to testing GR. We’ve got many gravitational-wave events and would like to use them _all together_ to figure out if our equations for gravity are correct. And here is the issue: there’s only one set (aka catalog) of black holes that contains all the black holes we’ve observed. Now that’s obvious you’d say, and you would be right!, much like we have a single Universe to observe (I’m not a language guy but indeed “Universe” means like [“the whole thing”](<https://www.etymonline.com/word/universe>)). This effect is known in cosmology (think those low-order multiples in the usual CMB plot), so we called it “the catalog variance of testing GR”. It’s bad, but the [Baron Munchauseen](<https://erikjanvankesteren.nl/blog/2018-03-01-baron-bootstrap.html>) tells us we can bootstrap.
