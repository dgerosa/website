My [little latex project](<../../../../../index.html?p=1108>) to compile bibliographies in a smart way was published by [JOSS](<http://joss.theoj.org/>). I really liked JOSS: it’s an innovative way to get recognition for your carefully crafted software, encouraging open science and good code practice. It’s really about publishing your code, not a paper that describes the code: they peer-review the repository, openly with pull requests.
