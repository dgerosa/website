Long and complicated (ok, let's say "multifaceted") paper by Federico today (seriously, there's a lot in here!). The LISA space mission will observe 10^many white dwarf binaries, so many that most of them won't even be separable. Those gravitational-waves will pile up in a foreground signal. The "shape" of that signal contains the astrophysics of white-dwarf binaries, which is the inference problem tackled in this paper.
