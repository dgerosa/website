Natal kicks imparted to neutron stars and black holes at birth can be constrained using LIGO data. Kicks cause misalignments between the spins and the orbital angular momentum. Here we compare large banks of population synthesis simulations to LIGO data using hierarchical Bayesian statistics and show that (already with 4 events!) natal kicks are constrained from both above and below. Simulated binaries are produced merging [Startrack](<https://www.syntheticuniverse.org/>) evolutions to my [precession](<../../../../../index.html?p=2119>) code. More on this very soon…

_Update_ : [here](<https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.02491.pdf>) it is!
