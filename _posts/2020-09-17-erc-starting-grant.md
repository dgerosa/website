I was awarded a [Starting Grant](<https://erc.europa.eu/news/StG-recipients-2020>) from the European Research Council for my program titled _“Gravitational-wave data mining”_. My team and I will look into gravitational-wave data, machine-learning tools, black-hole binary dynamics, stellar-evolution simulations, etc. The total awarded amount is 1.5M EUR. Here is the [press release](<https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/latest/2020/09/birmingham_scientists_awarded_share_of_677_million_to_unravel_scientific_mysteries.aspx>) from the Birmingham news office.

Thank you Europe, you’re great.
