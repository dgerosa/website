Happy to share that two PhD students in my group, Chiara Anselmo and Federico De Santi, both now starting their 2nd year, have recently received research prizes for their MSc-related work.

- **Chiara Anselmo** was awarded the *“Milla Baldo Ceolin – Women in Theoretical Physics”* prize. The award is sponsored by INFN and recognizes young female researchers who have recently defended an MSc thesis in theoretical physics. Chiara completed her thesis at Sapienza University of Rome with Andrea Maselli (who is also a friend of our group; ciao Andrea). See [here](https://www.infn.it/linfn-premia-le-migliori-neolaureate-in-fisica-teorica/).

- **Federico De Santi** received the *“Tito Maiani”* prize from the Lincei National Academy, dedicated to recent MSc graduates. Federico defended his MSc thesis at the University of Pisa with Massimiliano Razzano and Francesco Fidecaro.

Congrats to Chiara and Federico!
