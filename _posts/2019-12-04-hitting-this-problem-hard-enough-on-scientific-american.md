I was recently interviewed for Scientific American about [my recent paper ](<https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05295>) on multiple-generation black holes in stellar clusters. Here is the article: _[“Black Hole Factories May Hide at Cores of Giant Galaxies”](<https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/black-hole-factories-may-hide-at-cores-of-giant-galaxies/>)_. Very happy to be quoted saying “I don’t think we’ve been hitting this problem hard enough”. I think it’s a nice summary of scientific research –so much to discover!
