These are proceedings of the [IAU Symposium 338](<http://iau338.lsu.edu/>) “Gravitational Wave Astrophysics”, held in Baton Rouge LA on October 16-19, 2017. My contribution is based on arXiv:[1707.04637](<http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1707.04637>), where we look at the first binary black hole data using different Bayesian priors. During that conference, we had the announcement of the [first neutron start event](<https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/press-release-gw170817>), GW170817, and I was presenting black-hole science: so obsolete…
