I was awarded the 2016 [Stefano Braccini PhD Thesis Prize](<https://gwic.ligo.org/thesisprize/2016/>) by the Gravitational Wave International Committee (GWIC). The prize announcement reads:

_Dr. Gerosa received his Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge and was nominated by his adviser, Prof. Ulrich Sperhake. Dr. Gerosaâ€™s thesis includes a wide variety of topics relevant to gravitational waves, as well as other topics in astrophysics: astrophysical explorations of accretion disks, analytically challenging work in mathematical relativity and post-Newtonian theory, and numerical relativity coding of supernova core-collapse in relativity and modified gravity._

The prize was officially awarded at the [12th Edoardo Amaldi Conference on Gravitational Waves](https://web.archive.org/web/20180124014028/http://www.amaldi12.org/). Here is a picture [tweeted by Salvo](<https://twitter.com/sasomao>) :
