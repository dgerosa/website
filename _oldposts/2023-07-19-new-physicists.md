Two students just completed their Bachelor’s degree with research projects in our group. 

I had the honor of heading their graduation committee and could call them “physicists” for the very first time (and the Italian ceremonial sentence is quite imposing: “ _coi poteri conferitami…_ “). Congrats Simone and Leonardo!
