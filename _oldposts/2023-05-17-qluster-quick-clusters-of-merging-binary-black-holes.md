We’ve got the best name ever for a numerical code! Let me introduce QLUSTER which, guess what, simulates clusters. We finally put out a piece of code that was originally [developed in 2019](<../../../../../index.html?p=2604>) and later used in several papers. It’s a very very simple treatment of black-hole binary formation in dense stellar environments, with the goal of predicting gravitational waves from repeated mergers. The code is available at [github.com/mdmould/qluster](<https://github.com/mdmould/qluster>) and a short description is provided in the proceedings of the 2023 edition of the [amazing Moriond conference](<https://moriond.in2p3.fr/2023/Gravitation/>).
