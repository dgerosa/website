This paper came out of some discussions from our “[Gravitational-wave snowballs](<../../../../../index.html?p=6336>)” workshop in Sexten (Italy). We were discussing the good old problem of separating black-hole binary formation channels with spin measurements. Usually one says “aligned=isolated”, “isotropic=dynamical”. But then, some binaries that formed dynamically should also be eccentric. What we then realized is that, for those eccentric binaries and only for those, spin measurements can actually tell _which_ of the dynamical channel (because there are many…) is at play.
