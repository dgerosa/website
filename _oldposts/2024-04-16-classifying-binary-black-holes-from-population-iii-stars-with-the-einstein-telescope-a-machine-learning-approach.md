Population 3 stars are like “the original” stars. Those formed with material that comes straight from the Big Bang. It would be very (like, a lot!) cool to see them with gravitational-wave detectors. But can we tell them apart? Or do they look like all the other stars? Here is an attempt with a fancy machine-learning classifier.
