Welcome to the beautiful world of SBI, with this terrific piece of work by Pippa Cole. Here we’re looking at extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), that is, a small black hole orbiting a big black hole, which will be (one day) detected by LISA. These signals are nasty (long and of a very complicated morphology). We’re trying something new here – a deep learning called “truncated marginal neural ratio estimation” that does not even require writing down the likelihood of the problem. Just simulate all you can. The answer, this thing is _great_ for narrowing down the parameter space where EMRIs will be, kind of like searches do with current gravitational-wave data, but in a very different way.
