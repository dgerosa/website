I was selected by the European Space Agency to join the [Voyage 2050 Topical Teams](<https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/voyage-2050/topical-teams>). Voyage 2050 is ESA’s long-term programmatic plan to select scientific missions to be launched between 2035 and 2050. I am part of the review panel tasked to evaluate [mission proposals](<https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/voyage-2050/white-papers>) focussed on “ _The Extreme Universe, including gravitational waves, black holes, and compact objects_ “.
