These are my proceedings for the [12th Edoardo Amaldi Conference on Gravitational Waves](<http://amaldi12.org/>) (July 9-14, 2017, Pasadena CA). I summarize how to use black-hole spin dynamics to learn about the lives of stars using gravitational-wave data. There are surprises…

Before the talk, I was awarded the [2016 Stefano Braccini Thesis prize](<https://gwic.ligo.org/thesisprize/2016/>) (here is [Salvo’s tweet](<https://twitter.com/sasomao/status/885568668410683392>) about it).
