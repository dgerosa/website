Our workshop “[The disc migration issue: from protoplanets to supermassive black holes](<https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/meetings/2017/migration.issue.protoplanets.supermassive.black.holes>)” took place in May (2017) at the Cambridge Institute of Astronomy. Chaired by Cathie Clarke and co-organized by me, Giovanni Rosotti and a few other people, we tried to bring together people working on both planetary and black-hole physics, to understand what we have in common… Much like planets migrate in protoplanetary discs, supermassive black holes are also brought together by gas interactions. Same physics, different scales, right?

Here is the conference [program](<https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/meetings/2017/migration.issue.protoplanets.supermassive.black.holes>) (with some of the talk’s slides) and below is our beautiful logo (there are discs, waves, inspirals, and King’s College!). Thanks to the KAVLI and Templeton foundations for making this possible.
